Breast Cancer Risk Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer risk using machine learning models based on patient data. The dataset includes various clinical and demographic features that may contribute to a patientâ€™s risk profile.

Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

Patient Demographics: Age, Sex, Menopausal State, etc.
Cancer Characteristics: Cancer Type, Tumor Stage, Histologic Grade, HER2 Status, PR Status, ER Status, etc.
Treatment History: Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, Radio Therapy.
Survival and Relapse Data: Overall Survival (Months), Relapse Free Status (Months), and related metrics.
These features are processed and used to train models that predict breast cancer risk.

Project Workflow
The notebook follows these main steps:

1. Data Import and Exploration
Loading Data: The dataset is imported, and initial checks are performed for data quality and consistency.
Data Summary: A summary of key features, including distributions and missing values, provides an overview of the data.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Techniques are applied to handle missing data based on the characteristics of each feature (e.g., imputation, removal).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features are converted into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models, using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaling and Normalization: Numerical features are scaled to ensure all values are on a similar scale, which can improve model performance.
3. Feature Engineering
New features are derived based on existing columns to enhance model training and potentially capture complex patterns within the data.
4. Model Selection and Training
Model Choice: Various machine learning models are tested, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Models undergo hyperparameter optimization to identify the best settings for optimal performance.
5. Model Evaluation
Metrics: Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge their effectiveness.
Cross-Validation: Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure robust evaluation across different subsets of data.
6. Results and Interpretation
The best-performing model is identified, and results are presented to show its predictive power.
Feature Importance: For applicable models, feature importance scores highlight the most influential variables in predicting breast cancer risk.
7. Conclusion
Summary of findings and potential next steps, including suggestions for further model improvement or additional data collection.
